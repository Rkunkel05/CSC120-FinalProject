kingdom: The kingdom is a busy, large city with ancient and elegant architecture. Bright banners are draped from the large castle in the center. You can see a bustling marketplace filled with stalls and merchants shouting deals."
village: The village is a cozy, port-side town. Children run around the cobblestone streets, weaving through stalls packed with goods ranging from fish to exotic fur pelts. This could be a perfect place to set up shop!
forest: The forest is a labyrinth of green foliage, with only a skinny, well-traveled pathway marking where to go. It would be easy to get lost here if you went off the pathway… Who knows what creatures await here…!
ocean: The beach is small and sandy, with waves gently coming in at a low tide. Looking out over the water, you find yourself reminiscing over past adventures taken in distant countries. There is not much else to do here.
tavern: The tavern has a boisterous, loud atmosphere and is packed full of locals. A woman at the front counter gives you a smile, and she has a small nametag that reads 'Trish'.
