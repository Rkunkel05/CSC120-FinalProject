# CSC120-FinalProject

## Deliverables:
 - Your final codebase
 - Your revised annotated architecture diagram
 - Design justification (including a brief discussion of at least one alternative you considered)
 - A map of your game's layout (if applicable)
 - `cheatsheet.md`
 - Completed `rubric.md`
  
## Additional Reflection Questions
 - What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?
    Our overall approach to tackling this project was to break everything down to a few basic files and begin developing the code's skeleton. From the skeleton, we started to flesh out additional files and add as needed to the original files. 

 - What **new thing(s)** did you learn / figure out in completing this project?
    In completing this project, we learned about do-while statements. These proved to be particularly useful while coding loops for our game, such as the overall game loop and character creation. We found them to be particularly interesting because the code within the loop are always executed at least once whereas in while statements it only occurs if a given expression is true. 

 - Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?
    Retrospectively, we feel as though the map system (although more simple than Guava or other mapping systems) was still a little too complicated. We feel that it could have been simplified even further by removing the number system and instead just utilizing strings. 

 - If you had **unlimited time**, what additional features would you implement?
    We would implement a dice rolling system to add to the Dungeons & Dragons feel of the game. This would influence the effectiveness of a player's action. Additionally, we would add the ability to romance characters rather than only befriending them. 

 - What was the most helpful **piece of feedback** you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?
    During demo day, someone pointed out to us that they ran into a bug where the game would print "You are either not in the same location as that character or need to specify someone to trade with!" if they attempted to talk / trade / fight with a character without specifying their name first. They suggested that to fix this we should specify in the game options and in the character's dialogue options that the commands to talk / trade / fight have to include the character's name. Unfortunately we do not remember who suggested this. 

 - If you could go back in time and give your past self some **advice** about this project, what hints would you give?
    We would tell our past selves to get started as soon as possible! Especially the days leading up to demo day, we would ourselves extremly crunched with time and wishing that we had started coding more heavily even earlier. That being said, we would also encourage our past selves to make sure that we chunk down the project into manageable amounts and not try to conquer the whole thing in one sitting. 

 - _If you worked with a team:_ please comment on how your **team dynamics** influenced your experience working on this project.
    Given the scope of our project, working in a team made the project significantly more easy. It was very useful to be able to split up work and play into people's strengths to alleviate the load on what others struggle with in coding. Additionally, it was exciting to have so many ideas floating around. Ultimately it created a collaborative atmosphere that was very exciting to work in!
